					Before you file a report, have you tried these things?
				</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>Checking if the computer is plugged in.</li>
					<li>Turning the computer off and back on.</li>
					<li>Closing the program and re-opening it.</li>
					<li>Asking if someone in the room can fix it.</li>
					<li>Looking up the problem for a solution.</li>
					<!--could do with more ideas for this section, although its not a priority-->
				</ul>
			</div>

			<p class="lead">
				If none of these solutions work, then feel free to file a report below, we will
				be with you as soon as possible.
			</p>

			<!--
				IMPORTANT: Are you planning to use php because that is somthing I recommend avoiding.
				I like the spreadsheet idea but it would be better if we could use an actual database.
				Its up to you really, youre more qualified than I am to work on these things.
				You seem to know what youre doing anyways
				What do you suggest we do?

					<label for="theError">What is the error you're experiencing?</label>
					<input type="text" class="form-control" id="theError" name="error" placeholder="I'm having an error with...">
					<!--
						This allows for the program to ask for the error using the input box,
						where the submit button submits it to the spreadsheet which we do not have yet

			Requests the slider to be moved which then defines the severity of the problem, 100 being the maximum severity (entire network is at risk) Where 0 is the lowest (minimum risk to anything)
